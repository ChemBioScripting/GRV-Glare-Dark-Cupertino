# GRV-Glare-Dark-Cupertino
Emerald Theme for Linux Compiz Window Manager

This _Beryl Emerald Theme_ brings _Glare-Dark-Cupertino_ (xfwm4 theme for XFCE Linux Desktop) to Compiz.

### Requirements (for Fedora Linux):

Open a terminal and, as _root_ (or _superuser_), give the command:
```
# dnf install compiz fusion-icon fusion-icon-gtk ccsm emerald emerald-themes emerald-themes-extra compiz-plugins-main compiz-plugins-extra compiz-plugins-unsupported
```

Now, as a not _superuser_, launch the _emerald-theme-manager_ using its command:

```
$ emerald-theme-manager &
```

This command, at its first startup, will generate the `~/.emerald/theme` folder, containing the default theme. So, you need to import the _GRV-Glare-Dark-Cupertino.emerald_ file in `emerald-theme-manager` by clicking on the relative button which will generate the `~/.emerald/themes` folder, where you will find the _GRV-Glare-Dark-Cupertino_ theme installed: this is the simplest way.

Alternatively, after the download of the .zip file of this repository, you can insert its .png and .ini files in a folder called _GRV-Glare-Dark-Cupertino_, created manually in `~/.emerald/themes` and, opening the `emerald-theme-manager`, you will find it as an installed theme, searching its name in the search box area.
